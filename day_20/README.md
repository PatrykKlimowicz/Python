# Day 20 - Reduce visual noise with variable positional arguments

---

Please check the day20.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

-   Functions can accept a variable number of positional arguments by using \*args in the def statement
-   You can use items from a sequence as the positional arguments for a function with the \* operator
-   Using the \* operator with a generator may cause a program to run out of memory and crash
-   Adding new positional parameters to functions that accept \*args can introduce hard-to-detect bugs
