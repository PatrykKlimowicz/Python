---

Please check the day34.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

-   The _itertools_ functions fall into three main categories for working with iterators and generators:
    -   Linking iterators together
    -   Filtering the item they outpu
    -   Producing combination of items
-   There are more advanced functions, additional parameters, and useful recipes available in the documentation at _help(itertools)_
