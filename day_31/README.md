# Day 31 - Compose multiple generators with _yield from_

---

Please check the day31.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

-   The _yield from_ expression allows you to compose multiple nested generators together into a single combined generator
-   _yield from_ provides better performance than manually iterating nested generators and yielding their ooutputs
