# Day 7 - Avoid *else* blocks after *for* and *while* loops

---

Please check the day7.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

* Python has special syntax that allows *else* blocks to immediately follow *for* and *while* loops interior blocks
* The *else* block after a loop runs only if the loop body did not encounter a *break* statement
* Avoid using the *else* block after loops because their behaviour isn't intuitive and can be confusing
