# Day 8 - Prevent repetition with assignment expressions

---

Please check the day8.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

-   Assignment expressions use the walrus operator (_:=_) to both assign and evaluatevariable names in a single expression, thus, reducing repetition
-   When an assignment expression is a subexpression of a larger expression, it must be surrounded with parentheses.
-   Although _swith/case_ statements and _do/while_ loops are not available in Python, their functionality can be emulated much more clearly by using assignment expressions.
