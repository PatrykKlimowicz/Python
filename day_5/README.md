# Day 5 - prefer _enumerate_ over _range_

---

Please check the day4.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

-   _enumerate_ provides concise suntax for looping over an iterator and getting the index of each from the iterator as you go
-   Prefer _enumerate_ instead of looping over a _range_ and indexing into a sequence
-   You can supply a second parameter to _enumerate_ to specify the number from which to begin to count (zero is the default)
