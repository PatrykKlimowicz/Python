# Day 25 - Use comprehensions instead of _map_ and _filter_

---

Please check the day25.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

-   List comprehensions are clearer than the _map_ and _filter_ built-in functions because they don't require _lambda_ expressions
-   List comprehensions allow you to easily skip items from the input _list_, a behavior that _map_ doesn't support without help from _filter_
-   Dictionaries and sets may also be created using comprehensions
