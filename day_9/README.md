# Day 9 - Know how to slice sequences

---

Please check the day9.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

* Avoid beeing verbose when slicing: Don't supply 0 for the start index or the length of the sequence for the end index.
* Slicing is forgiving of start or end indexes that are out of bounds.
* Assigning to a list slice replaces that range in the original sequence with what's referenced even if the lengths are different.
