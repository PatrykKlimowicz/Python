# Day 3 - Write helper functions instead of complex expressions

---

Please check the day3.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Thing to remember:

-   Python's syntax makes it easy to writesingle-line expressions that are overly complicated and difficult to read
-   Move complex expressions into helper functions, especially if You need to use same logic repeatedly
-   An _if/else_ expressions provides a more readable alternative to using the boolean operators _or_ and _and_ in expressions
