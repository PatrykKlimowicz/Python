# 90 days of code 

In response of my willingness to improve my knowledge and quality of code I dare myself to a challenge:

### New important thing in Python everyday for 90 days

If You want to know best practices please stay tuned.
The main goal is of course to learn and to check my self-discipline as well.

Start: 13.12.2020

Based on "Effective Pyton" by Brett Slatkin

### Pythonic thinking ---> DONE
0. Discover the PEP8
1. Know the differences between *bytes* and *str*
2. Prefer interpolated f-strings over C-style format strings and *str.format*
3. Write helper functions instead of complex expressions
4. Prefer multiple assigment unpacking over indexing
5. Prefer *enumerate* over *range*
6. Use *zip* to process iterators in parallel
7. Avoid *else* blocks after *for* and *while* loops
8. Prevent repetition with assignment expressions

### Lists and Dictionaries ---> DONE
1. Know how to slice sequences
2. Avoid striding and slicing in single expression
3. Prefer catch-all unpacking over slicing
4. Sort by complex criteria using the *key* parameter
5. Be cautious when relying on *dict* insertion ordering
6. Prefer *get* over *in* and *KeyError* to handle missing dictionary keys
7. Prefer *defaultdict* over *setdefault* to handle missing items in internal state
8. Know how to construct Key-Dependent default values with *__missing__*

### Functions ---> ACTIVE FROM 29.12.2020
1. Never unpack more than three variables when function returns multiple values
2. Prefer raising exceptions to returning None
3. Know how closures interact with variable scope
4. Reduce visual noise with variable positional arguments
5. Provide optional behavior with keyword arguments
6. Use None and docstrings to specify dynamic default arguments
7. Enforce clarity with keyword-only and positional arguments
8. Define function decorators with functools.wraps
