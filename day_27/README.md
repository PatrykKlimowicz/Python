# Day 27 - Avoid repeated work in comrehensions by using assignment expressions

---

Please check the day27.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

-   Assignment expressions make it possible for comprehensions and generator expressions to reuse the value from one condition elsewhere in the same comprehension, which can improve readability and performance.
-   Although it's possible to use an assignments expression outside of a comprehension or generator expression's condition, you should avoid doing so.
