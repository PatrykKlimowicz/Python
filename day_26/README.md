# Day 26 - Avoid more than two control subexpressions in comprehensions

---

Please check the day26.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

-   Comprehensions support multiple levels of loops and multiple conditions per loop level
-   Comprehensions with more than two control subexpressions are very difficult to read and should be avoided
