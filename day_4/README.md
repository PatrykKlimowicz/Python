# Day 4 - prefer multiple assignment unpacking over indexing

---

Please check the day4.py to know to the topic from the code perspective.

## Things to remember:

-   Python has special syntax called unpacking for assigning multiple balues in a single statement
-   Unpacking is generalized in Python and can be applied to any iterable, including many levels of iterables within iterables
-   Reduce visual noise and increase code clarity by using unpacking to avoid explicitly indexing into sequences
